# Gamification E2E Verification Report

Scope:
- Validate points increments, history recording, badges awarding, confetti behavior, aria-live announcements, and Dashboard Gamification panel.

Key outcomes:
- Points alignment:
  - Save: +5 points backend; frontend optimistic increments aligned and Dashboard refresh reflects backend truth.
  - Feedback: +3 base; +1 bonus applied when long comments (>=120 chars) are submitted from Dashboard; Recommendations quick reactions map Like->rating 4, Dislike->rating 2.
- Badges (backend-driven):
  - First Save, Feedback Apprentice (>=5 feedback), Creative Champ (>=5 likes on creative-tag), Most Collaborative (quiz.collab high + like ratio >=0.6 with >=5 feedback), Consistent Contributor (>=5 feedback in last 14 days).
  - Dashboard badges grid: now tolerant to backend fields (id/badgeId, earnedAt/awardedAt) and shows description tooltip.
- Accessibility and motion:
  - Confetti triggers on new badge and Like action; respects prefers-reduced-motion.
  - aria-live live regions present across Recommendations (#sr-live), Dashboard (#sr-live-dashboard), and Gamification panel (#sr-live-gamification).
- Timeline:
  - Recent awards timeline shows most recent first.

Notes for QA:
- If backend is unavailable, api.getGamification falls back to zeros; actions still record optimistic increments locally, but the Dashboard panel prefers backend on refresh.
- To ensure exact totals, navigate to Dashboard after actions to trigger refreshGamification(teamId).
