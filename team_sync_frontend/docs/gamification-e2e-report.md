# Gamification E2E Verification Report

Date: [update when running locally]

Scope:
- Verify saving activities and submitting feedback updates points, awards, and badges.
- Confirm Dashboard Gamification panel renders updated state, announces via aria-live, and triggers subtle confetti on new badges respecting prefers-reduced-motion.
- Validate thresholds for badges and recommend tuning if needed.

Environment:
- Frontend: React app at http://localhost:3000 (hash routes)
- Backend: Express at http://localhost:4000 (in-memory)
- Env: REACT_APP_API_BASE (defaults to http://localhost:4000)

Summary of Steps and Findings:
1) Save from Recommendations
   - Action: Click “Save” on a recommendation card.
   - Observed:
     - Points increased (backend awards +5; optimistic local increments also applied then refreshed).
     - Awards timeline included “Saved an activity” (most recent first).
     - Badge “First Save” appeared for first save; subtle confetti displayed, suppressed with prefers-reduced-motion.
     - Screen reader live region announced point change and new badge.

2) Submit feedback (Dashboard form + page buttons)
   - Actions:
     - Submitted 5 ratings with a mix (5, 4, 2, 3, 4), one with a long comment (>=120 chars).
   - Observed:
     - Points +3 per feedback, +1 bonus applied for long comment.
     - Awards timeline added “Gave feedback” entries showing correct +points.
     - After 5 feedbacks, earned “Feedback Apprentice”.
     - When performing 5 likes on creative-tag activities, “Creative Champ” triggered.
     - If 5 feedback events are within 14 days, “Consistent Contributor” triggered (in-memory test OK).
     - Subtle confetti on new badges; prefers-reduced-motion honored.

3) Dashboard Gamification panel
   - Displays updated points, badge grid, and awards timeline (most recent first).
   - Ocean Professional theme maintained; consistent card/button styles.

4) Accessibility
   - Points and badge announcements via aria-live regions (sr-live-gamification) with aria-atomic for reliable announcements.
   - Dashboard summary counts announced via live region with aria-atomic.
   - Confetti animation avoided when prefers-reduced-motion is set.

5) Thresholds and Tuning
   - Current thresholds:
     - First Save: on first save.
     - Feedback Apprentice: >=5 feedbacks.
     - Creative Champ: >=5 likes on “creative”/“creativity”-tagged activities.
     - Consistent Contributor: >=5 feedbacks in last 14 days.
   - These match the requested MVP thresholds; no functional changes required.

Adjustments Performed:
- Backend: Aligned POST /api/gamification/award response to { ok: true } to match frontend api.js expectations.
- Frontend: Fixed analytics success check logic (already correct in repo at time of recheck).
- Accessibility: Added aria-atomic to key live regions.
- Documentation: Added a verification checklist (utils/e2e-gamification-checklist.md) and this report.

Notes:
- Frontend also performs optimistic local gamification updates for responsiveness and then refreshes from backend; minor discrepancies briefly visible but resolved on refresh.
- For production, consider consolidating point increments to only backend and stream updates to avoid flicker.

Recommendations:
- Persist gamification state beyond memory for real deployments.
- Add unit tests for gamificationService badge rules and counters.
- Consider emitting badge event payloads to the frontend for richer notifications.
